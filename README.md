ISS Tracker is a program that tracks the International Space Station and notifies me by email when it is visible from my home, provided it is nighttime, the sky is clear, and I have a telescope.


By obtaining the real-time ISS latitude and longitude, and knowing that its altitude is 400 km, it is possible to calculate its elevation above the horizon.
